# ToDoList
This is a basic To-Do List web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as done using a checkbox, and delete them with a trash icon. The interface includes helpful labels like "Mark as done" and "Delete" next to each option. A live clock is also displayed at the top. The design is clean, user-friendly, and works in any modern browser.
